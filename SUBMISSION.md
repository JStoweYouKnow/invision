# Gemini 3 Hackathon Submission

## Project Description (~200 words)

**InVision** takes the concept of a "Vision Board" and transforms it into an active, intelligent, and visually immersive journey using the power of **Gemini 3**.

While traditional goal setting is static and text-heavy, InVision uses **Gemini 3 Flash Preview** to instantly break down ambitious dreams into concrete, structured timelines with actionable steps. We leverage **Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview** to generate stunning, photorealistic visualizations of the user's future success, grounding their goals in sensory reality.

Key features powered by Gemini:
*   **Voice-to-Vision**: Users can speak their dreams into existence.
*   **The Guide**: A context-aware AI coach (powered by Gemini 3 Flash Preview) that offers personalized advice, motivation, and adjustments to the plan.
*   **Dynamic Themes**: Gemini analyzes the emotional context of a goal to generate a custom UI theme (colors, particle effects), making every user's experience unique.

InVision doesn't just list tasks; it creates a "memory of the future," helping users visualize, plan, and achieve their lifelong dreams.
