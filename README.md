# Invision 🌌
**The AI-Powered Living Vision Board**

> **Winner of Technical Excellence & Innovation** (Target)

Invision is a next-generation goal-setting platform that uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (Experimental)** to transform abstract ambitions into concrete, living plans. Unlike static todo lists, Invision creates an immersive, multi-sensory environment—ranging from cosmic voids to neural networks—that evolves as you grow.

## 🚀 Key Innovation: The "Wormhole"
Powered by `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`, the **Wormhole** feature acts as a deterministic life coach. It doesn't just ask "what do you want to do?"; it analyzes your profile and *invents* a tailored, ambitious life goal for you, complete with:
*   **Visionary Description**: A sensory-rich narrative of your future success.
*   **Strategic Timeline**: A backward-engineered plan from the goal date to *today*.
*   **Daily Habits**: Micro-actions to build momentum immediately.

---

## 🧠 Powered by Gemini 3 (3.0 Flash)
We leverage the cutting-edge multimodal capabilities of Gemini:
*   **Deep Reasoning**: Gemini 2.0 breaks down complex 5-year goals (e.g., "Colonize Mars") into actionable 2-week sprints.
*   **Visual Imagination**: We use `gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation` (with Imagen 3 fallback) to generate cinematic, 8k visualization art for every goal.
*   **Contextual Chat**: The "Guide" (AI assistant) retains full context of your unique timeline to offer relevant advice.

## ✨ Features

### 1. Dynamic Thematic UI
The entire application morphs to match your mental model:
*   **🪐 Cosmos Theme**: Goals are solar systems; tasks are planets.
*   **🧠 Brain Theme**: Goals are neural clusters; tasks are synaptic connections.
*   **🌳 Tree Theme**: Goals are forests; tasks are growing seeds.

### 2. The Timeline that Breathes
We replaced the Gantt chart with a **Living Timeline**. As you complete milestones:
*   Planets terraform.
*   Neural nodes light up.
*   Flowers bloom.

### 3. Community of Visionaries
*   **Fork a Vision**: See a goal you like? "Fork" it to your own board and adapt the AI's plan to your life.
*   **Real-time Motivation**: See what others are manifesting right now in the Galaxy Feed.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
*   **AI**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via Google Generative AI SDK)
*   **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
*   **Styling**: TailwindCSS, Framer Motion (Complex Physics Animations)
*   **Backend**: Firebase Firestore (Real-time Database), Firebase Auth

## 🔮 Strategic Roadmap

### Phase 1: AR/VR Integration (Next 6 Months)
Walk through your "Forest of Goals" in mixed reality using WebXR. Physically "prune" your leaves or "terraform" your planets.

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Simulations
Using competing Gemini agents to simulate potential future blockers (e.g., market crashes, health setbacks) to help users build "antifragile" plans.

### Phase 3: Monetization & B2B Scaling
*   **Premium Visualization Packs**: Direct-to-consumer digital theme sales.
*   **Corporate "Team Visioning"**: Using InVision for enterprise strategic planning, where the entire company contributes to a shared galactic goal.
*   **Executive Coaching API**: White-labeling our AI Guide for professional life coaches.
